# Zee 010 Templates
 A collection/backup of my 010 editor templates


Per file type templates are in the root directory.

Lib folder contains various helper structs that are common to most templates.

Other folders contain sub structs used in the main files in the root directory and can generally be ignore unless they require editing.
