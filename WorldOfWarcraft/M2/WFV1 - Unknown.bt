struct WFV1

};

// WFV1 = WaterFallVersion1 Tells that model has PBR-ish stuff and normal map.
// It uses separate render path from usual M2.

// First tested on waterfall in 8.2.0 (fdid 2445860).
// And at that moment it was WFV1.

// Later this same tech was used to create different models, which have no relation to waterfalls.
// But internally even the name "waterfall" was kept.

// Even stuff around areas in Shadowlands map is still called waterfall internally (fdid 3445776 for example).
// These models have WFV3 chunk.
