// A contiguous block of zero-terminated strings. 
// The names are purely informational except for "antiportal". 
// The names are referenced from MOGI and MOGP.

// There are not always nGroups entries in this chunk as it contains extra empty strings and descriptive names.
// There are also empty entries. The names are indeed referenced in MOGI, and both the name and a descriptive name are referenced in the group file header (2 firsts uint16 of MOGP).

// Looks like ASCII but is not: BWL e.g. has â€™, so probably UTF-8.
